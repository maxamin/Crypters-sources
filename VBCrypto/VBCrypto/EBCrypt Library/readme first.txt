SUMMARY:
This program simplifies the coding procedures of accessing the ebCrypt DLL library. All code was written by David Midkiff (mznull@earthlink.net). ebCrypt.dll is Copyright (c) 2000-2001, EB Design Pty Ltd.

DETAILED:
ebCrypt.DLL provides an interface in Visual Basic to access several powerful encryption and hash algorithms for use in virtually any type of project that calls for strong cryptography. The encryption algorithms include BLOWFISH, IDEA, TRIPLEDES, DES, DESE, CAST5, SERPENT128, SERPENT192, SERPENT256, RIJNDAEL128, RIJNDAEL192, RIJNDAEL256, RC4, and TWOFISH. The HASH algorithms include MD2, MD5, RipeMD-160, and SHA-1.

Simply register ebCrypt.dll with the regdll.bat file provided and then load the vbp file. modCipher.bas contains all the coding procedures necessary for utilizing the DLL properly. I won't go into a lengthy newbie explanation as I expect anyone who wants to use cryptography to have strong coding experience.

I do not provide support for the DLL as it was written by EB Design Pty Ltd. (www.ebcrypt.com) but I do provide support for the coding procedures I wrote to access the DLL. You can contact me anytime at mznull@earthlink.net. Please provide a detailed description of your problem and make sure it is only a problem with my coding routines and not the DLL. Thanks and enjoy!
