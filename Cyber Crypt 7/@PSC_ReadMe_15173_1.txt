Title: _*CyberCrypt7.0 - BUG FIXED*_
Description: --------Whats New with CyberCrypt Professional 7.0?---------
New advances:
|Whats a Swap archive?
A Swap archive acts the same as a normal non-compression
archive. But what happens is when adding a file, this type
of archive splits the file up into smallier pieces and uses
less memory.
|The Packed and Size properties:
If making an non-compression archive the Size and packed propertie
value should be the same. When having a compression archive
the Size and Packed properties are usually different, this varies
because files are compressed into the archive. The Size
propertie shows what the original size of the file is outside of
the archive. The Packed propertie shows the size of the file
while in the archive.
|Converting archives?
All the converting archive option does is change an archive which
has been made in an older version of CyberCrypt and converts into
the correct format for the newer versions of CyberCrypt.
|Coding Utility?
The Coding Utility CODE is created by James Gohl, Copyright 1999-2001
