' Visual Basic Gost Implementation
' David Midkiff (mdj2023@hotmail.com)
'
' Standard Gost implementation with file support, hex conversion,
' speed string concatenation and overall optimisations for Visual Basic.
' Gost supports 256-bit keys and is a stable algorithm developed
' by the former Soviet Union but there are many notable weaknesses and
' it remains in question if it really is much stronger then DES.
'
' Recommended for medium risk level solutions.
'
' Information on the algorithm can be found at:
' http://www.jetico.sci.fi/index.htm#/gost.htm
